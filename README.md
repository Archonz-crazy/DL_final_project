# Wildfire Prediction with Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for predicting wildfires using satellite images and weather data.

## Problem Statement

Wildfires pose a major threat to ecosystems, communities, and infrastructure around the world. Their increasing occurrence and intensity necessitate the development of reliable prediction systems for early detection and intervention.

## Project Goals

* Develop a deep learning model for accurate wildfire prediction.
* Utilize a combination of satellite images and weather data for improved prediction accuracy.
* Implement the model in a real-time application for early warning and response efforts.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect and pre-process satellite images and weather data from reliable sources.
2. **Model Design:** Develop and train a deep learning model using appropriate architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data and compare it to existing methods.
4. **Web Application Development:** Create a user-friendly web interface for easy access and utilization of the model.

## Model Selection

* **Basic CNN:** Demonstrated reasonable performance but lacked sufficient complexity for accurate prediction.
* **ResNet50:** Achieved high accuracy but suffered from overfitting, limiting itsgeneralizability.
* **VGG16:** Emerged as the best performing model, achieving high accuracy (90%) and low loss, indicating robust prediction capabilities.

## Web Application Features

* Upload images for real-time wildfire prediction.
* Visualize predicted fire locations and severity levels.
* Access historical wildfire data for analysis and trend identification.
* Provide user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the model.

## Project Outcomes

* Developed a highly accurate deep learning model for wildfire prediction.
* Implemented the model in a user-friendly web application for real-time use.
* Demonstrated the potential of deep learning technology for proactive wildfire management.

## Future Work

* Integrate additional data sources, such as social media and sensor networks, for further enhancement.
* Explore ensemble learning techniques to combine the strengths of different models.
* Develop explainability methods to understand model predictions and build trust.
